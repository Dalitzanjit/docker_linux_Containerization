https://github.com/Dalitzanjit/docker_linux_Containerization

In this assignment I want you to work in a team to create a website that teaches a new user about what Docker is and how it compares to virtualization.  You should use pictures, text, and link to other resources for additional information.  The website should have the following web pages:

1.  What is virtualization

2.  What is containerization

3.  How do they compare

4.  A tutorial on how to setup a web server on your local computer using docker

5.  A list of basic Linux commands and what they do   as well as how to log into your docker container.

6.  A tutorial about how to connect Docker with Pycharm to write python code.

 

Create a readme.md file in your repository and put a link to your website in the readme.  The website should be hosted using github pages.  Submit a link to the repository to this assignment.  You should use bootstrap and practice what you have learned about making web pages.
